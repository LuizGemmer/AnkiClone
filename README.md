# Anki Clone

This is a app made with the intention to learn the Electron and React frameworks, I just choose it to be a clone of the SRS application Anki because it is a aplication I use quite often, and just because.
Please do check out the Anki's official website at: https://apps.ankiweb.net/ (or just type "anki" on google).
